VI from below in two steps
BVI fails, Illusion
BRTDP below in one simulation if we go to 0, could also never go to 0 and never terminate from below; but this a.s. does not happen; also fails from above

More examples: 
	- VI off by 1 CHECK (red edge smaller than two times epsilon (depends on how term crit is implemented); then two iterations (one to propagate 0.5 to C, one to propagate a very small number to q) => ``no'' change => result 0)
	- littleqCEC with selfloop (takes forever to converge) CHECK
	- Converging EC (Prelim and BVIwo) CHECK
	- Complex BCEC (5 States, without starting state, with a b c d on the exits; also for the things are equal case) CHECK
