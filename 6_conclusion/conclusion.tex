\chapter{Conclusion And Future Work} \label{ch:conclusion}

General outline: We have found some stuff that is cool and we have guided a so far unexplored way of analysing Data

A huge benefit of including data analysis is that we could simply protoype an algorithm idea and assess very fast where on the spectrum of performance it lies.
Also we can simply add more algorithms and still have a good overview, maybe an even more solid overview. This is not the case with the tables.
Probably we would not even have tried $\TLPSI$ is we didnt have the visualization tools.

We have shown again that structure is very important for algo performance.

We have created an arbitrarily big or small benchmarking-suite for stochastic games that could be profitable for the whole stochastic game community. 
With the random models and our analysis tool we cool derive some interesting property of algorithm X and found out Y about algorithm Z.

\section{Future Work}
The features we track are all very basic, but it is a good step forward. However, we still cannot explain a lot of what is going on. 
For that we may need new structural concepts and features we track.

I believe that if someone would go further down this direction, a portfolio solver is definitely possible and maybe the best solution for users.

PRISM cannot handle explicit big files.
A next step would be to create an optimization system to create random files that hold chunks of the data in implicit blocks to make the files easier parseable.

The analysis techniques could be improved by including stochastic tests and artificial intelligence algos to cluster features and find correlations.
This could then even allow for a portfolio solver which decides based on machine learning which algorithm to apply based on the graph structure.
