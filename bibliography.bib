  abstract  = {Simple stochastic games can be solved by value iteration (VI), which yields a sequence of under-approximations of the value of the game. This sequence is guaranteed to converge to the value only in the limit. Since no stopping criterion is known, this technique does not provide any guarantees on its results. We provide the first stopping criterion for VI on simple stochastic games. It is achieved by additionally computing a convergent sequence of over-approximations of the value, relying on an analysis of the game graph. Consequently, VI becomes an anytime algorithm returning the approximation of the value and the current error bound. As another consequence, we can provide a simulation-based asynchronous VI algorithm, which yields the same guarantees, but without necessarily exploring the whole game graph.},

  abstract  = {A stochastic game is played in a sequence of steps; at each step the play is said to be in some state i, chosen from a finite collection of states. If the play is in state i, the first player chooses move k and the second player chooses move l, then the first player receives a reward akli, and, with probability pklij, the next state is j. The concept of stochastic games was introduced by Shapley with the proviso that, with probability 1, play terminates. The authors consider the case when play never terminates, and show properties of such games and offer a convergent algorithm for their solution. In the special case when one of the players is a dummy, the nonterminating stochastic game reduces to a Markovian decision process, and the present work can be regarded as the extension to a game theoretic context of known results on Markovian decision processes.},

  abstract  = {Quadratic optimization comprises one of the most important areas of nonlinear programming. Numerous problems in real world applications, including problems in planning and scheduling, economies of scale, and engineering design, and control are naturally expressed as quadratic problems. Moreover, the quadratic problem is known to be NP-hard, which makes this one of the most interesting and challenging class of optimization problems. In this chapter, we review various properties of the quadratic problem, and discuss different techniques for solving various classes of quadratic problems. Some of the more successful algorithms for solving the special cases of bound constrained and large scale quadratic problems are considered. Examples of various applications of quadratic programming are presented. A summary of the available computational results for the algorithms to solve the various classes of problems is presented.},

  abstract = {We consider partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with limit-average payoff, where a reward value in the interval [0, 1] is associated with every transition, and the payoff of an infinite path is the long-run average of the rewards. We consider two types of path constraints: (i) a quantitative constraint defines the set of paths where the payoff is at least a given threshold {$\lambda$}1 {$\in$} (0, 1]; and (ii) a qualitative constraint which is a special case of the quantitative constraint with {$\lambda$}1 = 1. We consider the computation of the almost-sure winning set, where the controller needs to ensure that the path constraint is satisfied with probability 1. Our main results for qualitative path constraints are as follows: (i) the problem of deciding the existence of a finite-memory controller is EXPTIME-complete; and (ii) the problem of deciding the existence of an infinite-memory controller is undecidable. For quantitative path constraints we show that the problem of deciding the existence of a finite-memory controller is undecidable. We also present a prototype implementation of our EXPTIME algorithm and experimental results on several examples.},

  abstract = {We consider concurrent games played on graphs. At every round of a game, each player simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointly determine the transition to a successor state. Two basic objectives are the safety objective to stay forever in a given set of states, and its dual, the reachability objective to reach a given set of states. First, we present a simple proof of the fact that in concurrent reachability games, for all ε>0, memoryless ε-optimal strategies exist. A memoryless strategy is independent of the history of plays, and an ε-optimal strategy achieves the objective with probability within ε of the value of the game. In contrast to previous proofs of this fact, our proof is more elementary and more combinatorial. Second, we present a strategy-improvement (a.k.a. policy-iteration) algorithm for concurrent games with reachability objectives. Finally, we present a strategy-improvement algorithm for turn-based stochastic games (where each player selects moves in turns) with safety objectives. Our algorithms yield sequences of player-1 strategies which ensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically (from below) to the value of the game.}

abstract="This paper presents a major revision of the tool GAVS. First, the number of supported games has been greatly extended and now encompasses in addition many classes important for the design and analysis of programs, e.g., it now allows to explore concurrent / probabilistic / distributed games, and games played on pushdown graphs. Second, among newly introduced utility functions, GAVS+ includes features such that the user can now process and synthesize planning (game) problems described in the established Strips/PDDL language by introducing a slight extension which allows to specify a second player. This allows researchers in verification to profit from the rich collection of examples coming from the AI community.",
