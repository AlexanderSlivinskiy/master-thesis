\begin{itemize}
	\item I want to thank Prof. Dr. Jan K\v{r}et\'{i}nsk\'{y} for giving me the opportunity to work on this topic. Working on this task was a very valuable experience for me.
	\item I want to thank Maximilian Weiniger and Muqsit Azeem for always being encouraging regarding the direction this thesis is taking. I want to thank them for always being very patient and helpful with all the questions and problems I came across throughout the thesis.
	\item I want to thank Calvin Chau for the endless conversations about theoretical computation and for sparking new ideas when I felt like reaching a dead-end in any task.
