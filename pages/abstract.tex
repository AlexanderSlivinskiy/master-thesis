Simple stochastic games are a formalism to model and verify stochastic settings with reactive systems.
We consider reachability games, where the goal of the first player is to reach a set of targets.
The goal of the second player is to prevent the first player from reaching any target.
While there are many algorithms to solve stochastic games with reachability objective, 
there is a lack of experimental data that can be used as a baseline for an informed decision on which algorithm to use in which situation.
In this thesis, we generate reachability games randomly to expand the benchmarking data set.
Furthermore, we provide tools for algorithm analysis that scale
with growing numbers of both the number of stochastic games we solve and the number of algorithms we analyze.
Lastly, we draw conclusions about the performance of algorithms solving simple stochastic game, utilizing the models and tools we introduce.
