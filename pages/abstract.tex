Simple stochastic games are a formalism to model and verify reactive systems in stochastic settings.
We consider reachability games, where the goal of the first player is to reach a set of targets.
The goal of the second player is to prevent the first player from reaching any target.
By now, there are many algorithms to solve stochastic games with reachability objectives.
However, there is a lack of experimental data and insight about which circumstances favor which algorithm, 
leaving users without a solid baseline for an informed decision on which algorithm to use to solve their problem.
In this thesis, we generate reachability games randomly to expand the benchmarking data set.
Furthermore, we provide tools for algorithm analysis that scale
with growing numbers of both the number of stochastic games we solve and the number of algorithms we analyze.
Lastly, we draw conclusions about the performance of algorithms solving simple stochastic games in relation 
to the structural properties of the stochastic game by utilizing the models and tools we introduce.
