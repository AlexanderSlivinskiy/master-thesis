\chapter*{\abstractname}
Simple stochastic games are a formalism used in modeling stochastic systems. 
We consider reachability games, where the goal of the first player is to reach a set of targets.
While there are many algorithms to solve stochastic games with reachability objective, 
there is a lack of experimental data that can be used as a baseline for an informed decision which algorithm to use in which situation.
In this thesis we generate reachability games randomly to expand the benchmarking data set.
Furthermore, we provide tools for algorithm analysis that scale well
with growing numbers of both the number of stochastic games we solve aswell as the number of algorithms we analyse.
Lastly, we draw conclusion based on the now facilitated analysis about the performance of some of the prominent algorithms.
